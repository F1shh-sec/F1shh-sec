<H1 align="center">I Make Tools That Break Things</H1>
Hello, my name is George and I am a Computer Security student at Rochester Institute of Technology.


 On my free time I write and develop cyber security tools, manage my homelab, and participate in CTF's. 
 
 Most of my tools are free and open source. Feel free to explore and contribute to any tools you take an interest in.  


Some of my tools, and by that I mean my main projects, are closed source. This is because they typically fall under the malware umbrella. If you are interested in learning more about those tools, please visit private tool information repo:
